# Automated Revision Notes Generator

This project focuses on developing an Automated Revision Notes Generator aimed at enhancing exam preparation by analyzing previous year question papers.The dataset is created by extracting important topics by identifying most repeated questions from the question papers. The system identifies common and crucial topics, generating comprehensive and concise revision notes. Users can upload PDF notes, which are converted to text and compared with a dataset of keywords to identify and summarize the most important topics. The generated summaries, facilitated by GPT-3 (Gemini), provide targeted and efficient revision material, ultimately improving study efficiency and academic performance. These notes can be then exported as pdf.
